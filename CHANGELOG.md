## 0.12.5

ISSUES FIXED:

* Wait for instance profile to be created before creating a new launch configuration
* beam credentials output a log message that broke scripts that parsed its output
* beam up ensures layers are sized according to the current production settings
* beam up -l works in more cases now by including gateways
* beam iam services zone information to fix an issue with recent version of fog
* Deployment file checksums are compared to prevent redeploying a poorly named war file
* Service discovery logs less when it can't find the private dns name (falls back to search mode)
* Fixed bug where key path cannot be relative for provision command
* Fixed bug that causes `--debug` to recursively log to Beam Enterprise

NEW FEATURES:

* Schedules now have the ability to set desired capacity
* AWS NAT gateways are now supported

```
subnets:
  - types: [public, gateway]

**prod.yml**:

```
- name: frontend
  deployment:
      type: newrelic
      buildNumber: 4
